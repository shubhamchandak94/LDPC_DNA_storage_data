# LDPC matrices

This directory contains the parity check and systematic position matrices used for the decoding. The generator matrix (needed only for encoding) can be generated by running https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/LDPC_DNA_storage/blob/master/util/generate_LDPC_matrices.sh. Note that the generator matrix files are relatively large (few GBs) and take a few hours to generate. 

Generating .gen file from .pchk file (using code from https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/LDPC-codes/):
```
./LDPC-codes/make-gen file.pchk file.gen dense
```

The generator matrices used for the experiments can also be directly downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DBainTAtng_B_HVlLftnnam9UmstYI1o?usp=sharing).
